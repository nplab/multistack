# MultiStack - Kernel Support for Multiplexing and Isolating User-space Stacks.

MultiStack is a kernel module that enables user-level network stacks to securely run alongside the in-kernel stack on the same NIC.

To isolate multiple network stacks including the in-kernel stack, a <dst ip address, dst port and protocol> 3-tuple is used. Currently, applications that run on socket APIs are isolated such that they exclusively use this 3-tuple through a call to bind() or equivalent system calls (except for special cases like fork()); MultiStack extends this primitive to user-space stacks.

For example, when a user-level stack wishes to use local port TCP 80 on a NIC configured with IP address 10.0.0.2, it must create a socket, call bind() with the corresponding 3-tuple, and register the tuple with MultiStack.

MultiStack is implemented as a module in [VALE](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/), a fast, scalable and modular software switch. A VALE virtual port is used to interconnect a user-level stack and a NIC. MultiStack forwards packets from the NIC to the different virtual ports (or the in-kernel network stack) based on the set of currently registered 3-tuples. It also validates packets sent from virtual ports to ensure that they match the registered 3-tuples.

## How to Build the Code (Linux)

1. Make sure you have [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) installed.

2. In the Multistack directory:
	- cd LINUX
	- make KSRC=PATH_TO_KERNEL_SOURCES NSRC=PATH_TO_NETMAP_SOURCES
	
	
## How to Use the Code (Linux)

Assuming you've already installed netmap and Multistack in ~/netmap and ~/multistack respectively, and that you configured your PATH environment variable to include ~/netmap/examples/ and ~/multistack/examples/ : 

1. Instantiate a VALE switch named "valem:", and attach eth1 and the in-kernel network stack to it:

	- vale-ctl -h valem:eth1

The vale-ctl command is included in [netmap](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/), and the "-h" option attaches the in-kernel network stack to the switch.
	
2. Load the MultiStack kernel module
	- insmod ~/multistack/LINUX/multistack_lin.ko
	
## How to Run Apps

Applications or user-level stacks that run on top of the netmap API can be easily ported. To run a user-level network stack or app:

1. Run the app on top of a virtual port that attaches to the switch instance "valem:", represented by "valem:vp0".
	- You can choose arbitrary name for "vp0"
	- You don't need any system-wide configuration to create "valem:vp0". When your app registers this name with nm_open(), the virtual port is dynamically created.

2. Create a socket and bind() a 3-tuple.
	- This process is important so that afterwards MultiStack can confirm this process owns credential to this 3 tuple.

3. Issue an ioctl() for a file descripter opened by nm_open() (you can refer to it with nmd->fd) with MULTISTACK_BIND as an argument in order to register this 3-tuple with MultiStack.
	- Here MultiStack internally checks if the caller process owns credential to register this 3 tuple. Since you have bind()ed this 3 tuple, it will success.
	
4. You can now send (raw) packets whose source matches this 3 tuple, and receive (raw) packets whose destination is this 3 tuple on "valem:vp0" using netmap API.

For more details, see multistack/examples/pkt-gen.c (a modified version of netmap/examples/pkt-gen.c that can run on top of MultiStack)
	
## How to Build the Code (FreeBSD)

Assuming that the kernel source code directory is `/home/tuexen/head/` use
````
cd multistack/sys/contrib/multistack
env SYSDIR=/home/tuexen/head/sys make
````

Please note that you need r285877 or higher of the FreeBSD HEAD sources [(see patch)](https://svnweb.freebsd.org/changeset/base/285877) to get multistack compiling with SCTP support.
